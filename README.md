* This is a source code of encryption and decryption algorithm based on a binary plus, such as octave, decimal, hexadecimal, and so on.
* The same password can be used forever without change. Of course, there is no password too. However, there must be random numbers.
* The encryption and decryption algorithm of this program adopts the algorithm of "JunTai" distribution random number.
* The so-called "JunTai" distribution refers to the disorderly distribution of each number on the axis of the number, its value appears only once without repetition.

* It's just a demo version, the official version includes low-level version, intermediate version and advanced version.
* If you want to source code of official version, please contact me.
* I hope who can crack this algorithm one day in my lifetime.
* If you break this algorithm, please let me know. Thank you very so much!
